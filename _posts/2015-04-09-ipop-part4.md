Hi all, till now we have successfully established a VPN using IPoP.
Lets setup `SSH` so that Bob can remotely access Alice's computer!

## Step 1: Install SSH server
For those who don't know SSH (Secure Shell Script), it allows you to access a system running a SSH server over a network. Say if Bob wants to remotely use Alice's computer, then Alice should start a SSH server. Alice will install ssh server by

{% highlight shell %}
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
{% endhighlight %}

and check if it is running (this should result in a process id)

{% highlight shell %}
$ pgrep sshd
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 2: Bob logs in on Alice's computer
From stage 3, we know that for Bob, Alice's IP is *172.31.0.101*
Bob log's in by using following command
{% highlight shell %}
$ ssh 172.31.0.101
{% endhighlight %}

and enter Alice's password.

The result is Bob being able to successfully log in to Alice's computer over the internet.

![Successful SSH]({{ "/assets/ipop-part4/img5.jpg" | absolute_url }})

To exit back to SSH session run
{% highlight shell %}
$ exit
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 3: Transferring Files
Bob can download files present on SSH server(Alice) to his local system by doing
{% highlight shell %}
$ scp user@172.31.0.101:/path/to/localfile /path/to/Destinationfile
{% endhighlight %}
